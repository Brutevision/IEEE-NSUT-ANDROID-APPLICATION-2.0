Our foremost objective is to create an environment which promotes students to learn technical knowledge, inculcate managerial skills and develop their overall personalities. We achieve this by sponsoring technical projects, providing opportunities to manage and organize events and to participate in various events and conferences at state as well as national level. IEEE-NSUT Student Branch works to create an atmosphere of technical excellence for the students. It aims at helping students in building an attitude towards applying engineering in daily life by learning ways to use the latest technology on offer.
.\n\n• Our vision is to:\n
I. Foster technical initiatives and innovation among students.\n
II. Add to their qualifications by enabling them to learn new skills.\n
III. Serve as a forum for collaboration in technical projects.\n
IV. Equip engineers in the making with the right kind of leadership and interpersonal skills.\n
V. Define a vision for present and future student members to work forward.
